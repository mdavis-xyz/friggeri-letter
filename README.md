# friggeri-letter

This is a LaTeX template for a cover letter to go with a resume created with the [friggeri-cv resume template](http://www.latextemplates.com/template/friggeri-resume-cv).

## The letter

All resumes should have a cover letter (so I'm told). It would be inconsistent to stick a normal LaTeX letter in front of a friggeri resume. Also, a normal LaTeX letter is not as eye-catching.

This letter class uses the same eye catching header as the Friggeri CV, and uses the Roboto font.

## The resume


I've also modified the original friggeri-cv template:
* The original one used the *HelveticaNeue* font family, which costs money. I changed it to use the almost identical *Roboto* font family, which is free. For convenience, I've included the *Robot* fonts in this repo.
* I adjusted the coloring of the headings in the resume, so the whole heading is coloured, not just the first 3 letters. To install the fonts, just double click on them in a file browser. Your operating system should then ask if you want to install them.
* I tinkered with the spacing of the column where you enter the years, so that new line breaks are automatic.
* I changed the link coloring, so that links are the same colour as everything else
* I got rid of the bibliography stuff, because who needs a bibliography in a resume?
* I adjusted the *aside* section (the contacts in the left margin), so now they appear on every page. The motivation for this is in case the pages of a hard copy get separated. In the example, the name appears in the contact details in all but the first page (because it's in the header on the first page). This template change means changing `aside` from an environment to a command. So look at the example to see the new syntax.

## Usage

* Install the fonts.
* Have the `.cls` file(s) in the same folder as your `.tex` file(s). (There's probably a way to install them properly. I don't know what that is.)
* Start with the example `.tex` file(s) and modify them to suit your needs.
* This template needs to be compiled with XeLaTeX

## To do

* Change spacing so that everything lines up relative to the 1/3 fold mark
* Add option to only put contact details on the first page
* Get rid of magic numbers in the templates, so it works with other paper sizes. (Then again, who doesn't use A4?)
